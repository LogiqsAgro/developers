praise: 
    As a family man I like to work in a team to get the best out of ourselves. I structure the world with code, but not that much that I only see Matrix-style images. You can always contact me for questions about software architecture, DDD, any issue you run into in the whole stack of coding. Since I work here, I can now even answer some questions about Linux! Further more I love privacy, Cloud, Formula 1 and 007. 
about_working_at_logiqs:
    It's great to work in an environment where you see your .Net Core code working on a Raspberry Pi and Linux machine. Also setting up a new project from scretch is a joy. You get the time to learn on the job and have the possibility to try new tools and techniques. And in the end,... we contribute to make the world a better place!
professional_interests: 
    Software Architecture, Design Patterns, DDD, .NET Core, C#, gRpc, Azure, Databases, Raspberry Pi
