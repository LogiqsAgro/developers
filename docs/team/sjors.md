praise: 
    I always want to finish the work we planned. 
    If it takes more time then expected I will put in more time, even if it means I need to work longer. 
    Thereby, I can focus on 1 task untill it's finished. 
    I am not distracted very fast.
about_working_at_logiqs:
    I really like programming software for real machines. The thinks you programm are visible and are physically doing something. Besides that i really like the logistic challenges in the warehouses.
professional_interests: 
    Solving difficult logistic problems.
