You are responsible for answering all questions about our software products. 
This ranges from how do I make the system work again to what kind of server do I need? 
Besides that you are responsible for installing, updating or migrating our software stack on the server of the customer. 

You are the person that can tell anybody how our system works and what they need to configure in order to do so. 
You make sure you build up an (internal) knowledge base and improve customer documentation. 
To the Software Team you act as an important stakeholder because you can indicate where we need to focus our improvements. 
You will categorize requests, find trends and point out where product improvements will have the most impact on reducing support requests. 

You will be our driving force for improvements.
