## Requests for clarification

### No cover letter

Hi there,

Thank you for showing interest in our open developer position.
I did not receive a motivation letter with your resume.
Could you send it to me? A simple reply to this email is sufficient.

We value alignment with our mission and our core values more than anything else.
That is why we will not process your application without a motivation letter.

Thank you,

~Marijn
