## Frequently Asked Questions

### Remote work at Logiqs

> Thanks for sharing @marijn! Is fully online development or coaching also possible, for the people that don't live in the Netherlands?

Although many of our teams are working remotely for a considerable part of the week, due to Covid regulations, we do prefer on-site team members.

Our offices are located in the same building as our prodcution facility.
For our team members it is highly beneficial to be close to our machines and -more importantly- to the people that build, test and commission our machines.

### Relocation to the Netherlands

> Do you support relocation to The Netherlands?

We are very inexperienced in this regard.
This means we might not be able to move as quickly as we are used to doing.
But we are very curious to find out how we can make this happen.
