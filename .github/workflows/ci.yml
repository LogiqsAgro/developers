# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # use Ruby, no need to specify a version, because we have a .ruby-version
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@477b21f02be01bcb8030d50f37cfec92bfa615b6
      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Bootstrap
        run: | 
          cd docs
          make bootstrap
      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          make test
          echo Done.
